Lets talk about making a website:
you want a grid? javascript
you want to change the sort order of a list? javascript
you want to animate scrolling? javascript
you want to animate rotation and translation at different speeds? javascript
you want to filter items from a list? javascript

javascript is a turing complete language and can do everything, the only
thing we need to change would be the layout model which we deal with,
the basic CSS and HTML are adequate only when coupled with javascript.



- Fix the gaps CSS left with laying out elements.
- Remove the performance hindrances which CSS comes with:
  - float
  - margin
  - position: relative, fixed, static

- Enforce constraints everywhere not leaving out those between data and layout
- Improve querying and sorting capabilities on collections of data
